# Pythonic Monopoly (Assignment)
In this assignment, I was asked to analyze two data files and generate a dashboard of interactive visualizations to represent the analysis.
This dashboard presents the analysis of residential rental properties in San Francisco from 2010 to 2019. You can access the data by navigating through the tabs. The number of housing units, average housing rental, average sales price per square foot in different neighborhoods, and average gross rent has been included in this visual analysis.
