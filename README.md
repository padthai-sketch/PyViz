# Pythonic Monopoly (Assignment)
In this assignment we are required to analyse two data files: San Francisco Neighborhood Census Data and Neighborhood Coordinates. Then create a dashboard of interactive visualizations to represent the analysis. 

This dashboard presents the analysis of residential rental properties in San Francisco from 2010 to 2019. You can access the data by navigating through the tabs. The number of housing units, average housing rental, average sales price per square foot in different neighborhoods, average gross rent have been included in this visual analysis.
